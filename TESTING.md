Having created the website for mainly desktop, each workflow was tested following development, using [Monday.com](https://view.monday.com/1055700560-c01e5354c02ab53b9f7b9e492d44d50f?r=use1) to 
provide structure to the testing, during development and then after set live using Gitpages. 

Testing conducted outside of the development tool on the following;

iPhone SE2020
iPhone 12
iPad Pro 9.7"

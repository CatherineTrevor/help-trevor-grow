# Project Overview

This project is my Milestone Two project with the Code Institute. This project augments the lessons from module 1 regarding HTML5 and CSS, and introduces JavaScript and jQuery.
Help Trevor Grow is a free-to-play, simple memory game designed for children approx. age 3 - 6 years old. One item of fruit is displayed in the middle of the playing area (Image A), with three images underneath (Images A, B and C), one of which is always the same as Image A. Image A fades out after 15 or 10 seconds depending on the level selected, then the player must select the same item from the three images below. There are three levels, each slightly more difficult than the last level.

# User Experience Design

## Strategy

The game is designed primarily for use on a desktop, with limited help needed from an adult where a player is able to follow the instructions themselves. Receiving guidance from a qualified Early Years Manager to ensure the game is age appropriate, there must be nothing unecessary on the screen to distract the player, allowing them to focus on the game.

The levels available increase in difficulty:

**Egg**

This is the simplest level. Image A is of one piece of fruit, which fades out after 15 seconds. The three image options below are visually very different from each other, to make the game age appropriate. The intended age for this level is 3.

**Caterpillar**

The images shown now contain 3 items of fruit, but the options below still differ enough to make it challenging, but also possible. The target age for this level is 4.

**Butterfly**

Designed as the hardest option, this will show a quantity of fruit Image A. The three options below will be of the same fruit, but different quantities so the user must count to select the correct answer, making it slightly more difficult. The target age for this level is 5.

Although there are three levels of difficulty, each level is loosely based on age range, but it is not intended as a test to see what "level" the child is at. The game is for fun. The game can be played as many times as required.

# Project Overview

This game has been built as part of the Milestone Two project with the Code Institute. The project augments the lessons from module 1 regarding HTML5 and CSS and introduces JavaScript and jQuery.
Help Trevor Grow is a free-to-play, simple memory game designed for children approx. age 3 - 5 years old. One item of fruit is displayed in the middle of the playing area (Image A); it fades away after 5 seconds and then three images underneath appear (Images A, B and C), one of which is always the same as Image A ([see wireframe in SKELETON.md](SKELETON.md/#play_detail)).  
The player then selects the same item from the three images displayed to gain a point and move to a new image. There are three levels, each slightly more difficult than the last level.

# User Experience Design

## Strategy

The game is designed primarily for use on a desktop, with limited help needed from an adult where a player can follow the instructions or use a mouse without assistance. 
For players that cannot use a mouse, the game is best played on a touch screen device (tablet, mobile phone for example). Receiving guidance from a qualified Early Years Manager to ensure the game is age-appropriate, there must be nothing unnecessary on the screen to distract the player, allowing them to focus on the game.

The levels available increase in difficulty:

**Egg**

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/images/egg.jpg" height="200">
</div>

This is the simplest level. Image A is of one piece of fruit, which fades out after 5 seconds and the player then has unlimited time to click the corresponding image from the options below. 
The three image options are visually different from each other, to make the game age-appropriate. The intended age for this level is 3.

**Caterpillar**

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/images/caterpillar.jpg" height="200">
</div>

Image A contains 3 items of the same piece of fruit, but the options below still differ enough to make it challenging. The target age for this level is 4.

**Butterfly**

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/images/butterfly.jpg" height="200">
</div>

Designed as the hardest option, this will show a higher quantity of fruit Image A, and then differing quantities of different fruit below. This means the player must not only note the type of fruit but also count it, making it slightly more difficult. The target age for this level is 5.

Although there are three levels of difficulty, each level is loosely based on age range, but it is not intended as a test to see what "level" the child is at. The game is for fun can be played as many times as required.

Once the player reaches 10 points for a level, they are taken to the next level up. Having completed the final level, the game starts again.

### Target Audience

The target audience is both parents/adults with young children, as they will connect to the game and if needed, help the child to play. The players are intended to be children from approx. age 3 to 5. 
The game must be colorful and appealing to the player, whilst to a degree, educational and easy to play.

## User Stories

**Adult first-time site visitors**

    a. As an adult first-time visitor, I want to easily navigate the site and quickly start a game.

    b. As an adult first-time visitor, I want to understand how to play the game, so I can explain it to my child if necessary.

    c. As an adult first-time visitor, I want to feel confident that the game is free-to-play and age-appropriate.

    d. As an adult first-time visitor, I want to understand what my child can gain from the game.

    e. As an adult first-time visitor, I want to know how to make the game more personal such as changing the level or some aspect of the site.

**Child first-time visitor goals:**

    a. As a child first-time visitor, I want to quickly understand the rules of the game.

    b. As a child first-time visitor, I want to have fun playing an online game.

    c. As a child first-time visitor, I want to have some independence in play and feel the game is personally for me, by making my own choices.

    d. As a child first-time visitor, I want to feel good when I select the correct option.

    e. As a child first-time visitor, I want to understand that I got an answer wrong, but feel motivated to try again.

    f. As a child first-time visitor, I want to feel encouraged to try the next level.

## Scope

**Existing Features**

Based on the User Stories from the target audience, the game contains the following features:

 Feature  | Details  |
|---|---|
| Nav bar| Links to "How to play", "About" and "Contact" info always from the top of the page |
| Introduction pop-up modal | Basic information about the game and how to play. This pop-up modal displays automatically on site opening, so there is only one file/page. |
| Footer | Copyright logo.  |
| Images | Fun, colorful, age-appropriate. The images of the fruit will be very simple, with nothing else included (i.e. not in a basket or on a tree).  |
| About | Background information about why the game exists. This will be displayed underneath the playing area. |
| Contact | Email address.  |
| Play | Large colorful buttons representing each level, to start and play the game, so it is clear to the player what they should do.  |
| Color options | Color options to change the background so the player can personalise the game and have an appropriate level of control. |
| Correct / Incorrect answer pop-up | Clear information, whether the player selected the correct or incorrect answer. |
| Correct answer marker | Clear information that the player has answered the questions correctly which increments the score after every correct answer. There will not be a counter for incorrect answers. |

**Future features**

**Feature 1:** Animation. In the future, the Egg should grow into a Caterpillar, and then a Butterfly, to fly away at the end, giving more life to the game. 
At present, I do not know how to create this feature.

**Feature 2:** More levels. The game is very basic, but future features will include more levels, up to age 7, which are more complicated.

## Structure

The game has a very basic structure. How to play information is provided in the pop-up modal, which appears automatically when the site is opened. The same information, written for the adult audience is accessible from the playing page.

JavaScript is used to change the playing levels, so there is only one HTML file.

## Skeleton

For wireframes and game workflow [see separate Skeleton file.](SKELETON.md)

## Surface

### Typography

The site uses Rocknroll from Google fonts, with sans-serif as a backup. It has been chosen as it looked "fun" and engaging to meet the requirements of the child target audience, but also easy to read for those starting to learn.

[Google Fonts - Rocknroll](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/RocknRoll+One?preview.text_type=custom&preview.text=Help%20feed%20Trevor%20the%20Caterpillar!&selection.family=RocknRoll+One)

### Imagery

[See separate Imagery file.](IMAGERY.md)

### Color Scheme

Due to the player audience, the site uses the following clear, simple colors:

**Header and footer text:** white (#FFF)

**Main play area and pop-up modal text:** darkslategray (#2f4f4f)

**Main background color:** whitesmoke (#f5f5f5)

**Background colors:** red (#ff0000); green (#00ff00); purple (#800080); pink (#ffc0cb); orangered (#ff4500); blue (#00f)
